    // GLOSSARY
    $summary = "<p>Every page on every website on the internet is made up of HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the language that computers understand when they are reading an HTML file. You'll write some of these files in HTML when you start making websites. </p><p>Because HTML is a markup language, we use tags to tell the computer how to format a website. For example, the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag makes text bold. An opening tag has a less-than sign and a greater-than sign with the tag name in the middle. You can also put attributes in the opening tag to modify it's behavior. Almost all tags have a closing tag â€” a less-than sign, a slash, the tag name, and a greater-than sign. </p><p>Every HTML file begins with the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tag. This tells the browser (a broswer is an application that reads HTML and displays it on your screen) what version of HTML it will read. Then the whole document is wrapped in an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. </p>";
